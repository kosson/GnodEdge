# GnodEdge

![](intro.png)

Creator of nodes and edges for Gephi

Requirements:

- Install Obsidian from Obsidian.md. Create a new vault having the subdirectory gnodedgeplan as target. Opening Obsidian, you get a visualization with the planned steps in application development;
- Ensure you have Node.js version 20.2.0 (i suggest installing with nvm);
- Create a file in the root of the project called publications.sqlite. This will be the Sqlite3 database.

Important note: This is work in progress. The first stable app will be marked by the first release.
